# Coffee-Quality-Analysis - Power BI Project
 The project is about analyzing the CQI dataset to identify key sensory attributes that influence coffee quality, examine correlations between processing methods and quality scores, and explore trends in defect occurrences impacting overall coffee quality.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee quality using a dataset provided by CQI to identify sensory attributes that influence overall coffee quality.

## Objectives
- Determine the key sensory attributes affecting coffee quality.
- Explore correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and quality scores.
- Identify trends in defect occurrences and their impact on quality.
- Conduct What-If analysis to explore various scenarios and their effects on coffee quality.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop

## How to Use
1. Open the `Coffee_Quality_Analysis.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore the visualizations and insights generated from the dataset.

## Key Insights
- Coffee from the Piendamo region in Cauca, Colombia, using the double anaerobic washed method, has the highest quality ratings.
- Sensory attributes like flavor and aftertaste significantly impact overall coffee quality.
